    "TaskDescription": "We used a paradigm comprising of a series of dynamic videos, which has been already validated in previous clinical investigations (Schacher et al., 2006). The videos were all silent and consisted of dynamic fearful faces and dynamic neutral landscapes, presented in an alternating order, in a block design. The paradigm included eight blocks of 75 short video clips (2–3 s) of fearful faces (aversive condition) and nine blocks of 72 short video clips (2–3 s) of neutral landscapes (neutral condition). Each block lasted 24 s in total, and contained short video clips without any intermission between consecutive videos. Video clips of fearful faces were extracted from thriller and horror movies and contained faces of actors showing fear, without being violent or aggressive. Video clips of neutral landscapes were chosen as a control condition, and were matched to the duration of the fearful faces videos (2–3 s). They included domestic landscapes which are posited to have a low emotional content and visual properties comparable to the emotional videos (Schacher et al., 2006). All videos were only included once. A panel of psychologists had evaluated the stimuli to ensure that they are suitable for the patients and that they do not include any episodes of violence or aggression (Schacher et al., 2006). In particular, we started with a set of 120 videos of fearful faces and reduced that to 72, by excluding videos where: (a) the actor’s face was not continuously visible (b) fear was not clearly recognized on the actor’s face (c) no other emotion was displayed (e.g. anger/surprise) and (d) the display of fear was intense. During electrophysiological recordings the videos were presented to the patients via a laptop screen, while during the fMRI scan they were presented through a tilted overhead mirror. In both cases, patients were instructed to pay attention to the videos and focus on the eyes of the actors during the clips containing faces. For the electrophysiological recordings, blocks were separated by a repeated baseline of 2 s taken from a neutral condition.The task is available at http://www.neurobs.com/ex_files/expt_view?id=283",
